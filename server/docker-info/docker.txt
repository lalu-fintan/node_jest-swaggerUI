images:
  It's like blue print for a containers, 
  which means it just store the some depentancies, like runtime enviroinment,depentancies and commands.

  images made up with several layers.

  1.parent image
  2.source code 
  3.depentancies
  4.run command


  1.parent image - which means our os , like node or python or php something.

container:
It running instance of our image, and run our application
Dockerfile is used to create an automated Docker build that can be executed on any system with Docker installed.


volumes:
  it same like a nodmon , when ever w change anything in our code then if we run the container it show the build code process only ,
  - are used to persist data outside container lifecycle
  - they can be binded to host machine filesystem
  it's only for dev perpose , if we want to share the image toanyone we need to rebuild the container.


  compose:
   if we use multiple images like node ,mongodb and react , then we build all the image to be container , that's why we use compose.
   is tool that helps in managing multi-container docker applications.
